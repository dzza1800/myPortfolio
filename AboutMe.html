        <p>I am a adrenaline fuelled person, who focuses on adapting around every situation and place to make myself known and happy which then further allows me to socialise
        and interact with everything around me, thus making myself feel comfortable. <br><br>
            
            I don't necessarily believe in hard work, I mostly believe in smart work, by working to reach a criteria with an efficient timing plan and brain workout. Hard work means alot of different things but for me, it doesn't always equal a successful outcome because in reality if we all keep doing smart work, we'll finish way above a deadline and gives us more time to overperform if wanted. In simpler terms the quicker a minimum viable product(MVP) is produced, quicker the ability to extend the product is then procured. Sure quicker can result in a bad product but when it comes to working smart, the first thing comes to mind for me is, find a simpler solution that focuses in present and future developments also known as, scalability. <br><br>
            
            I completed University as of July 21st 2022 (Gradation date) in the field of Computer Science and had a rough 3 years due to coronavirus causing a loss of lectures, no inperson events, isolated socialism etc. However throughout those 3 years I was able to improve my skills in teamwork, problem solving and more. As for teamwork as lectures were often cancelled and almost <em>non existent</em> me and my friends often worked together, helping each other understand coursework, course content and just socailsing remotely. Finally in third year there was an increase in inperson activities and thus teamwork improved even more due to the intensive work we had to do which was a struggle as the uni decided to act as if the first 2 years were done normally where in this case it never did. <br><br>
            
            As for problem solving, being isolated gave me the motivation to learn more about topics I wouldnt have looked at before, such as solving electronic problems in hardware in computers, consoles and controllers where at one point, I fixed a relative's playstation due to it overheating in intensive gaming, took me a while but I fixed it successfully to the point where, two years later, it never caused an issue again even on the extremest of gaming.
