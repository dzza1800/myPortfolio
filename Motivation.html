        <p>My Motivation is created by own understanding of things around me, and from my motto thats features on the homepage mirrors that. I made that quote up during my time at college as college for me was a stepping
            stone onto a new place to adapt and try to belong to. <br>
            Due to my hyper personality an assumption can be made that im not a serious person, but in reality this hyper personality drives me to do the things I always want to do, in other words makes me motivately driven. <br>
            Due to my dreams, I try to be the best of my ability to reach my personal goals and dreams and for me dreams aren't dreams, they're future achievements, I just have to work towards it. <br><br>
            Heres a little video of one of my inspirations and a representation of being motivately driven. <br>
